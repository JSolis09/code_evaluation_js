# Exercise 4
First I installed `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux` and configure the application store
In the excercise 2, I mocked the status list in the storage, then I created `CurrentStatus` and `Status` components, I followed the Figma design and created the clasess and styles, then I created a basic layout in order to test the component. After finishing I created unit test for the components that I create

In the excercise 3, Also I installed `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`, for purpose testing I created a server in node using express in order to mock the get APIs, then I created the services in the application, and created a createAsyncThunk function to fetch all the request, then I created a logic to map each dwelling with its device and return a array of devices and set in the application store. In the App JS, I dispatch the event, get the data and render the list of devices and company name. After finish I created the Unit test for this component.

to run the uni test:

go to 2 directory,
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`(omit if you already did this step before) and `npm run test`

and see in the console that tests report.

same way for excercise 3
go to 3 directory, then you can run

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`(omit if you already did this step before) and `npm run test`

and see in the console that tests report.
